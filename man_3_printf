_PRINTF			Linux Programmer's Manual		_PRINTF

NAME
	_printf

SYNOPSIS
	#include "main.h"

	int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
	The function _printf is our own version of the original printf function. 
	It has the same behavior and it produces an output according to a format.
	You pass a string as the first argument, and you can specify an
	unlimited number of formats specifiers (more exemple below).
	For each format specifier you specify, you have to put an argument who
	's corresponding to the type of the format specifier.
	For example, if you put 3 formats specifiers (one int, one char and one
	string) you have to put 3 arguments after the formatted string of the
	corresponding types.
	
	This function is not handling all the functionnality of the original one.
	
	For the moment it's handling: 
	%s: string
	%c: character
	%d: Integer value as signed decimal integer
	%i: Integer value with decimal, hexadecimal or octal type.

EXAMPLES
	_printf("Hello World\n");
	Output: Hello World

	_printf("Hello %s, you have %d years.\n", "Philippe", 27);
	Output: Hello Philippe, you have 27 years.
	
	_printf("Your initials are %c%c.\n", 'P', 'W');
	Output: Your initials are PW.
	
	_printf("Octal: %i, Decimal: %i, Hexadecimal: %i\n", 010, 8, 0x08);
	Output: Octal: 8, Decimal: 8, Hexadecimal: 8

SEE ALSO
	printf(3), write(2)

BUGS
	The negative numbers for %d are not working yet, we're working to fix
	it.
